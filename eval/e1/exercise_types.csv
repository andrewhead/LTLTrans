Exercise,Given,Find,Given Repr,Question In Words?,Answer Needs Words?,Has Math Notation,Unexpected,Bad Description,Notes3.1a,prop,model,text,y,n,y,n,n,"Event counter drawn, but is not the focus"3.1b,prop,model,text,y,n,y,n,n,"(Shares pre-prompt with 3.1a, which is where math notation happens)"3.1c,prop,model,text,y,n,y,n,n,"(Shares pre-prompt with 3.1a, which is where math notation happens)"3.2a,prop,model,text,y,n,n,n,n,"3.2b,c both require written text answers of type ""property"" (see below)"3.3a,prop,model,"drawing, text",y,y,y,n,y,Asks you to write a formal description of a model from its drawing4.1,prop,model,text,y,n,n,n,n,4.2b,prop,model,"drawing, text",y,n,n,n,n,This really asks you to use a model and new property to make a new model4.3,prop,model,text,y,y,n,n,n,"Some of these questions are ""why?"" questions, which obviously need sentances"4.4a,prop,model,text,y,n,n,n,n,4.4b,prop,model,text,y,n,n,n,n,4.5,prop,model,text,y,n,n,n,n,Asks questions about the model that it is assumed that you construct.  I would call this more a behavior spec than a property spec.  What's the difference?4.6,prop,model,text,y,n,n,n,n,4.8,prop,model,"drawing, text",y,n,n,n,n,"Again, seems like behavior, not property""9.4b,e,f,g",prop,model,"pseudocode, text",y,n,n,n,n,9.6,prop,model,text,y,y,n,n,n,"Again, seems like behavior, not property"13.2c,prop,model,text,y,y,n,n,n,"This almost looks like it takes traces and generates models.  Optional ""explain"" subpart"13.3,prop,model,"drawing, text",y,n,n,n,n,Drawing is of a similar machine.  Prop is non-determinism and # of states3.3a,model,prop,drawing,y,n,n,y,n,Answer is in form of formal description3.3b,model,trace,drawing,y,y,n,n,n,3.3c,model,"prop,trace","drawing, text",y,y,n,y,n,3.5,model,trace,text (traces),y,n,n,n,n,4.2a,model,trace,drawing,y,n,n,n,n,Antecedent to 4.2b.3.2b,model,prop,self-generated,y,y,n,n,n,Students use model (probably drawing) THEY'VE generated for 3.2a.  Answer requires both number and explanation3.2c,model,prop,self-generated,y,n,n,n,n,"Students use model (probably drawing) THEY'VE generated for 3.2a.  Requires Boolean answer, not explanation"12.3a,model,prop,"drawing, text",y,n,n,n,n,"12.3b looks like it could be a ""find model"" problem"9.5c,"model, trace",trace,"drawing, text",y,n,n,n,n,3.4a,"model, prop",trace,drawing,y,n,n,n,n,3.4b,"model, prop",trace,"drawing, text",y,n,n,n,n,4.3,"model, prop",trace,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,y,This problem doesn't look like it provides a property to look for a trace12.1a-h,"model, prop",trace,"drawing, LTL",n,y,n,n,n,Trace only required as counterexample if false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
